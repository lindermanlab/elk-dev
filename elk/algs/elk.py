    Run ELK to evaluate the model. Uses a Kalman filter.

    Args:
      f: a forward fxn that takes in a full state and a driver, and outputs the next full state.
          In the context of a GRU, f is a GRU cell, the full state is the hidden state, and the driver is the input
      initial_state: packed_state, jax.Array (DIM,)
      states_guess, jax.Array, (L-1, DIM)
      drivers, jax.Array, (L-1,N_noise)
      sigmasq: float, controls regularization (high sigmasq -> low regularization)
      num_iters: number of iterations to run
      quasi: bool, whether to use quasi-newton or not
      AR: bool, basically evaluate autoregressively (Jacobi iterations, zeroth order) 
      deer: bool, whether to use deer or not (equivalent to sigmasq=infinity, but more numerically stable)
    Notes:
    - The initial_state is NOT the same as the initial mean we give to dynamax
    - The initial_mean is something on which we do inference
    - The initial_state is the fixed starting point.

    The structure looks like the following.
    Let h0 be the initial_state (fixed), h[1:L-1] be the states, and e[0:L-2] be the drivers

    Then our graph looks like

    h0 -----> h1 ---> h2 ---> ..... h_{L-2} ----> h_{L-1}
              |       |                   |          |
